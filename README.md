# **Smart Mirror**
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tenoriojuann/SmartMirror.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tenoriojuann/SmartMirror)
## **Overview**
### A smart mirror is a product that provides you with useful information at the moment when you need it the most. We provide several OPTIONAL widgets that vary from traffic information to a twitter news feed. 

### Having traffic/weather information while getting ready in the morning is extremeley beneficial as you can put on your make up or tie your tie while reading the critical information for the day. As we think of more widgets to put on the widget enjoy the current ones and let us know of any improvements that can be made to this project via PRs or Issues.
